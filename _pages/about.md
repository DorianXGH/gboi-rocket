The Gameboy of Isaac is a project aiming to recreate the famous game "The Binding of Isaac" on real Gameboy hardware, using assembly language.   

On the github page you can find downloadable ROM to try to game for yourself !   

This blog relates the developement process, our discoveries, game design elements and technical implementation details.   
As this project is two weeks long, there is also a section logging day to day progress. 

If you're looking to communicate with a coffee machine instead, look [here](../418.html).
