We are coding a Game Boy version of The Binding of Isaac. Therefore, we are using the gbZ80 assembly language.

After a little more of a week working on that project, we want to explain to you what have been done and present our prototype. Basically everything that we planned for the first milestone [here](../first-milestone) has been achieved, appart from isaac's tears that are still a work in progress. 

First, we wanted to focus on displaying a room and Isaac in order to have a decent working basis. For the moment we achieved to display: a room, its walls and background and obviously, Isaac. It’s possible to interact with him because he reacts to the inputs of the user and can freely walk around to the extent of the obstacles surrounding him. In fact, we have implemented the collision between them.

Check out the possibilities of our project as you wish. You can download the first release [here](https://github.com/PainsPerdus/gboi-rocket/releases/tag/v0.1)

From now until our next milestone we want to add the tears that Isaac shoots and enemies (at least static). In a more distant future, we want to add diversity among the rooms’ skins, an automatic aim for Isaac’s tears, move from one room to another and mobility to the enemies.
