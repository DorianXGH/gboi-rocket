    - started working on displaying tears on the screen, with the challenge of displaying more elements on screen than the GameBoy usually allows
    - tested the possibility of recycling sprites during the HBlank

* Jean-Marie and Thomas
    - step by step implementation of collisions or Isaac : first with one rock, then several rocks, now several elemets blocking or not
    - added collisions for walls in order to prevent Isaac from leaving the screen
    - set up the mecanism letting Isaac look in the right direction
    - refactoring collisions for better performance and in order to allow Isaac to "slide" against a blocking element

* MÃ©lissa and Dorian
    - custom version of the score "Sacrificial" from the original game, adapted to a 2 channel player
    - first version of the map generation, coded in C
