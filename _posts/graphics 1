Hi there, 
we've worked a little bit on the first sprites of the games and getting a good preview of what we want it to look like. 
We also did some worlk in the way to give our improvised studio some visual signature.

It turns out drawing with 3 colours and a canvas of 16 by 16 pixels is'nt that easy !
Here is the first look on our sobby little guy Isaac.
![Isaac](../../assets/images/isaac.png){: height="100px" width="100px" .align-center}

We needed some ugly ennemies worth fighting so here are some flies and bees ready to swarm into Isaac's nigthmares.

![fly](../../assets/images/fly.gif){: height="100px" width="100px" .align-center}

Just add some rocks, walls, doors and projecticles and here is what the game will look like !

And to conclude, we are proud to introduce our new logo and its 2bits equivalent which will show up upon launching the game !
