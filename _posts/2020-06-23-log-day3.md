## Day Summary

Today was a big day. With the great help of [Tony](https://github.com/ChatPion), we made an algorithm  able to convert a png file into something readable by the gameboy and managed to make it appear on the screen.
We experienced some issues due to unsiffucient communication and wrong uses of github. It allowed us to improve our workflow.

  - **Game Design** : 
  Worked on collisions, wrote a template of documentation.
  - **Graphics** : 
  displayed a backgound test and isaac's sprite.
  [first look](../../assets/images/first_sprite.png){: height="288px" width="320px" .align-center}
  - **Music** :
  working on the implementation of the driver and converting from MIDI to a format playable by the gameboy.
  - **Software engineering** :
  worked on game structure.
  

* Comming soon:
  - sprite animation !
  - full code structure
  it lives !
