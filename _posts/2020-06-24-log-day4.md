## Day Summary

* Virgile and Pascal
    - challenge : animate Isaac, while standing, walking and attacking in any direction, and with as few sprites as possible
    - optimized version of Isaac : only 14 sprites, reusing the sprites as much as possible
    - when Isaac turns, only his head rotates
    - the way sprites are positionned is crucial as Isaac is a superposition of several sprites

* Jean-Marie and Thomas
    - implementation of the collision functions
    - collisions can now be detected and resolved (movement canceled, damage applied, interactions called)
    - still a problem : no knowledge about the side of contact, should be implemented later

* Jean-Marie
    - creation of a structure for the code which allows anyone to add his bit of code easily
    - this structure has been approved by the rest of the team
    - documentation for this is currently being written

* Dorian
    - working on a code to convert a score into a custom music format

* MÃ©lissa
    - Working on a programm which takes the custom music format file and plays it on the GameBoy
    - Use of time interrupts to play notes at a rather regular pace

## TODO

* have a first version of the programm in which Isaac can walk in a room
