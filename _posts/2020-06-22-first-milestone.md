## We defined the first milestone for the project

* Make one basic room with rocks and doors
* Isaac character that can:
  - Move
  - Shoot bullets
  - Collide with its environment
  - Have a walking animation
* Bullet physics and rendering on the Window

## Concept Art

We tried to stay as close as possible to the original game graphical mood. We had to remove the fake 3D effect for simplicity though. 
The game will look more like the original Binding of Isaac rather than the remake.
