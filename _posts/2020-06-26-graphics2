Hi there, 

It's been a while since the first update but as you will see, we've been pretty busy !
Isaac now moves in all four directions and has a minimal walk animation. we had to sacrifice some of the aestetics for the sake of code efficiency. 

In order to reduce memory space used and execution time, we exploited some particularities of isaac's sprite.
As you can see [here] (../../assets/images/graphics1/isaac_frames.png), isaac is very symetrical and turning him left and rigth is almost the same as making his eyes/tears disapear.
