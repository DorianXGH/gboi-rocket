Hello world,

Today, I worked on implementing a xorshift RNG algorithm for the gameboy. It's based on this implementation in C : https://github.com/edrosten/8bit_rng

Pseudo code corresponding to the assembly version I implemented looks like this :

```c
void rng() {
    t = x ^ (x << 4);
    h = t ^ (t << 1);
    x = y;
    y = z;
    z = a;
    a = z ^ (z >> 1);
    a = a ^ h
    return a
}
```

A xorshift algorithm is quite easy to implement, fast (20 instructions), and remarkably good at producing randomness.
